## **About the Research**

In this experiment, we explored how a jailbroken state in GPT-4o could be seamlessly transferred to GPT-01 by simply pasting the conversation transcript. The study reveals key shortcomings in context sanitization and highlights the importance of improved input validation mechanisms in AI systems.

The detailed methodology, findings, and implications are discussed in the article:
